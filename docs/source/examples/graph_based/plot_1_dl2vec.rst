DL2Vec
========

This example corresponds to the paper `Predicting candidate genes from phenotypes, functions and anatomical site of expression <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa879>`_. 

This work is a graph-based machine-learning method to learn from biomedical ontologies. This method works by transforming the ontology into a graph following a set of rules. Random walks are generated from the obtained graph and then processed by a Word2Vec model, which generates 
embeddings of the original ontology classes. This algorithm is applied to generate numerical representations of genes and diseases based on the background knowledge found in the Gene Ontology, which was extended to incorporate phenotypes, functions of the gene products and anatomical location of gene expression. The representations of genes and diseases are then used to predict candidate genes for a given disease.

To show an example of DL2Vec, we need 3 components:

- The ontology projector
- The random walks generator
- The Word2Vec model

Projecting the ontology
-----------------------

We project the ontology using the DL2VecProjector class. The rules used to project the 
ontology can be found at :doc:`/graphs/projection`. The outcome of the projection algorithm
is an edgelist.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: default


    dataset = GDAMouseDataset()

    projector = DL2VecProjector(bidirectional_taxonomy=True)
    edges = projector.project(dataset.ontology)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-56

Generating random walks
-----------------------

The random walks are generated using the DeepWalk class. This class implements the DeepWalk
algorithm with a modification consisting of including the edge labels as part of the walks.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-65

.. code-block:: default


    walker = DeepWalk(20, # number of walks per node
                      20, # walk length
                      0.1, # restart probability
                      workers=4) # number of threads

    walks = walker.walk(edges)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-70

Training the Word2Vec model
---------------------------

To train the Word2Vec model, we rely on the Gensim library:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-75

.. code-block:: default


    walks_file = walker.outfile
    sentences = LineSentence(walks_file)
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, epochs = 20, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-82

Evaluating the embeddings
------------------------------

We can evaluate the embeddings using the
:class:`EmbeddingsRankBasedEvaluator <mowl.evaluation.rank_based.EmbeddingsRankBasedEvaluator>`
class. We need to do some data preparation.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-86

.. code-block:: default


    from mowl.evaluation.rank_based import EmbeddingsRankBasedEvaluator
    from mowl.evaluation.base import CosineSimilarity
    from mowl.projection import TaxonomyWithRelationsProjector







.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-89

We are going to evaluate the plausability of an association gene-disease with a gene against all
possible diseases and check the rank of the true disease association.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-99

.. code-block:: default


    genes, diseases = dataset.evaluation_classes

    projector = TaxonomyWithRelationsProjector(taxonomy=False,
                                               relations=["http://is_associated_with"])

    evaluation_edges = projector.project(dataset.testing)
    filtering_edges = projector.project(dataset.ontology)
    assert len(evaluation_edges) > 0








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 100-102

The gene-disease associations will be scoredc using cosine similarity. For that reason we use
the ``CosineSimilarity`` class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-115

.. code-block:: default


    vectors = model.wv
    evaluator = EmbeddingsRankBasedEvaluator(
        vectors,
        evaluation_edges,
        CosineSimilarity,
        training_set=filtering_edges,
        head_entities = genes.as_str,
        tail_entities = diseases.as_str,
        device = 'cpu'
    )

    evaluator.evaluate(show=True)
